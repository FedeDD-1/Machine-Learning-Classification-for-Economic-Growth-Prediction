# Machine-Learning-Classification-for-Economic-Growth-Prediction
What does the code do?
This script applies machine learning classification to predict whether a region's economy grew by more than 5% based on
OECD data. The dataset includes economic and demographic indicators for NUTS3 regions in 2019. The script loads and
preprocesses the data, splits it into training and test sets, and runs three classifiers: Random Forest, Logistic Regression,
and Multilayer Perceptron. Each model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a
confusion matrix.
How to use the code?
To run the code, ensure you have Python installed with required libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn). Place the dataset files
in the same directory as the
script. Execute the script (python script_name.py), and it will automatically load and process the data, train the classifiers,
and display the results. The output includes classification metrics and a confusion matrix, helping to evaluate each
model's performance in predicting economic growth.
